## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Interactive Course Catalog**: Displays a collection of cards representing different musical instruments. Hovering over each card changes its background color, providing a visual cue to users.
- **Embedded YouTube Video**: Includes an informative video embedded directly on the page, giving prospective students a deeper insight into what Musicdot offers.
- **Enrollment Options**: Presents two distinct enrollment plans in a visually appealing card format, each with a 'Sign Up' button for user convenience.
- **Benefits Section**: Highlights four compelling reasons to enroll at Musicdot, each accompanied by descriptive text and relevant imagery.
- **YouTube Channel CTA**: Directs users to Musicdot's YouTube channel with a call-to-action button and includes thumbnails linking to specific videos.
- **Mobile App Information**: Describes the availability of the platform on Android and iOS devices, with download links for both.
- **Footer Section**: Contains numerous links to courses, contact details, and social media platforms, along with a newsletter signup field for promotional emails (note: the signup functionality is visual only and not operational).
- **Contact Page**: Dedicated page detailing the company's history, location, unique selling points, and multiple contact methods.
- **Enrollment Page**: Features a dynamic list of courses with options to select multiple courses. The total number of selected courses and the cumulative duration are automatically updated based on user selections.
- **Confirmation Modal**: Upon confirming course selections, a modal pops up to confirm the enrollment or to inform that no courses have been selected. Successful confirmations redirect users back to the main page.
