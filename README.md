## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: Development of an enrollment page: When clicking on the "Matricule-se" button, you are redirected to the enrollment page. Using JavaScript, a page with course selection, including their names and durations, has been created. After selecting the desired courses, clicking on the "Confirmar matricula" button opens a modal window confirming that the enrollment has been completed and redirects you back to the main page.
- `Feature 2`: Development of a contact page: Clicking on the "Contato" button redirects you to a page showing a bit about who the company is and a brief history, as well as its unique selling points, and, of course, the company's contact information for customers.
- `Feature 3`: Visual of the pages created using Bootstrap and CSS.
- `Feature 4`: Insertion of a short promotional and explanatory video on the main page with playback and controls directly on the page, without the need to be redirected to another site for playback.
